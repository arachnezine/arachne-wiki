# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.6.0] - 2018-02-13
### Added
- `autogit` option: disables the plugin.

### Changed
- Git `user.name` and `user.email` local configuration are no longer replaced. Instead, the plugin now sets the author with the `git commit --author` flag.
- The plugin no longer checks if the `content` folder is a Git repo since it required an extra command to be run. Use the `autogit` option to disable the plugin when needed.
