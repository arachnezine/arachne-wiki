arachneâ€™s wiki, storing all material going to be published later on on the zine.

We move from etherpad to sketch out ideas and  having conversation, to a plain-text file system, based on git, to revise text and finalise it.

the wiki manages also our planning, todos, and calendar (or how we deal with time between europe and the US).
