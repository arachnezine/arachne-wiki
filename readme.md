arachne.wiki
============

wiki holding all working files, ideas, processes, etc + etherpad / cryptpad + org sys (todos, cal, etc).

for now running on [kirby cms](https://getkirby.com), using [commonmark](http://commonmark.org) for the markdown, using `git` + [kirby autogit](https://github.com/pedroborges/kirby-autogit) + [diff2html](https://github.com/rtfpessoa/diff2html) to work with text files in a collaborative way and display all the changes overtime.

mostly private (through login), but experimenting with publishing some article as public, and aiming to use it with future collaborators as a replacement of googledocs, by way of setting up [prosemirror](https://github.com/ProseMirror/prosemirror).

in the long run, planning to use the p2p [dat protocol](https://datproject.org) and play with ways of collaborate and publish in that way.
